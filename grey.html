  <div>This is a fictional brand film of ‘grey’. I think grey is not only a color but the spectrum of brightness. Likewise, the concept of grey has various colors, movings, and possibilities. I used the shape of ‘g’ in Cooper Black typeface that looked like a playful child who had a lot of potentials.
