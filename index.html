    <h3>Grey</h3>
    <p><a href="https://vimeo.com/249643871" target="_blank" title="HTML Specsific">Grey</a> is the fictional brand film.</p>

Likewise, the concept of grey has various colors, movings, and possibilities. I used the shape of ‘g’ in Cooper Black typeface that looked like a playful child who had a lot of potentials.
